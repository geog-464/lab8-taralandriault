						For my final project, I wish to take a look at the change in average rent price accross the boroughs of the Island of Montreal over a ten year period.

						It is no secret that the city is in the middle of a housing crises. Personally, being I first moved to this city in 2017, I have noticed a great increase in the average rent when I look on the various platforms where rental advertisements can be found. Furthermore, with the rising cost of life as a whole many feel more and more financially unstable. This has caused myself and many of my loved ones anxiety so I thought it could be interesting to take a deeper look into the subject.

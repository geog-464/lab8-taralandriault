						The goal of this lab is to introduce you to basic, static webpages and their standard structure. This webpage provides you with a template which you could use to learn about the various elements that make up a webpage. Your tasks are to modify the content and styling of this webpage to your liking (or replace it entirely, if you're capable of that!). Have fun with it!

						What you are currently seeing is basic text contained inside an html tag called p.
						This webpage contains no JavaScript whatsoever, but you can already see how some elements are responsive by only using CSS.<br>
						<li>Right-click anywhere and click on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Open_the_Inspector" target="_blank">Inspect</a> (it may involve a different step for different web browsers). This is an extremely helpful feature of your web browser!</li>
						<li>This is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul" target="_blank">list item</a></li>
						<li>HTML elements are typically stored in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" target="_blank">divs</a></li>
						<li>Experiment with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size" target="_blank">font-size units</a> px, %, em, calc, etc.</li>
						<li>It is worth reading up on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout" target="_blank">CSS grid layout</a> since the current page is structured that way. This is relatively new to CSS and allows you to easily structure webpages without external libraries such as <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">Flexbox</a>, etc. CSS grid layout may appear complicated to many, so take your time with it.</li>
						<li>I will add more tips and links during the lab based on questions..</li>
						<li>Final note: you don't need to become a pro at this, but be aware that knowing the ins and outs of HTML and CSS is fundamental to basic web design. You can, however, get away with not knowing much if, for example, you are more focused on embedded webmaps, which we will get to next week and which are styled differently. Still, the bones that hold everything together are what you see right in front of you!</li>

						<b>Deliverables:</b> Your own modified webpage, uploaded as a Github page, containing your project proposal for the GEOG 464 term project!
						<br><br>
						<b>Evaluation:</b> This should be an easy lab since, at minimum, you can basically get away with replacing the text in this website and call it a day! However, 50% of the this lab's evaluation will go to design, this means that (a) your webpage shouldn't contain any glaring errors (e.g. unclosed html tags that don't render properly) (b) your webpage should make sense semantically (i.e. the right html tags are used for the right elements in the overall hierarchy of the page), (c) it should look better than what you were provided with!

# lab8 - Term project proposal via a static webpage

This lab is due **March 23 at 14:45**, and its deliverables include your term project proposal. *You do not need to send the instructor an email regarding your project proposal any longer* as it is now part of lab 8.

The lab instructions are available in `index.html`. To view the html page properly, you should download the files in this repo directly to your computer or clone it using command line as previously done in labs.

When downloaded, open `index.html` in your web browser, as well as with a text editor. It is best for you to have these open and visible side-by-side on your computer.

As you edit the webpage files, you may want to make commits now and then, however they likely won't be needed considering you are not asked to do any programming in this lab... Once you have completed the lab (as outlined in `index.html`), you should push/upload your work to your repo.

When you are satisfied with your webpage and have uploaded/pushed it to your repo, you need to make your index.html visible on the web. Github makes this possible with a nifty feature called [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), which basically turns your repository into a webserver (see below):
- You can tell if a Github repo is deployable as a website when:
  - On the right-hand pane, under **Environments**, there is a *github-pages* link.
  - After clicking this link, in the following page, you are able to view the site by clicking the topmost **View deployment** link.

If your repo is't already deployable as a Github page, you can make it such by doing the following (updated instructions from [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site):
- Make your repo public (in the settings, bottom of General tab)
- Then click the Pages tab:
  - choose your main branch as the Source
  - make sure /root is selected
  - click Save
